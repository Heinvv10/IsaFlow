# Assurance programme — findings register

Every finding surfaced while building the MCP assurance endpoints, with what has
actually been done about it. Started 2026-09-03.

**Why this file exists.** Findings were accumulating in session messages between
workstreams, which is where they evaporate. A finding that is not written down
did not happen, and this programme's entire premise is that a system should be
judged on what it can prove.

**Status vocabulary — read this before using the table.**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FIXED` | Code changed and merged. |
| `FIXING` | Code change in flight in a named workstream. |
| `REPORTED` | Confirmed, deliberately NOT fixed here. Owned by someone else, or out of scope. |
| `OPEN` | Confirmed, nobody owns it yet. **These need a decision.** |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Claimed but not yet re-derived. Do not act on it. |

**Two standing scope rules** decided by Hein on 2026-09-03:

1. **Correcting the books is out of scope and happens after.** We build the
   endpoint that FINDS the problem. Every data correction is a separate decision
   with its own approval.
2. **Do not extend the write path.** The value is in read and assurance
   endpoints. The write path already works and the books are still wrong.

## A. The specification itself is unreliable

`docs/mcp/isaflow-mcp-endpoint-audit-2026-09-03.md` was written from outside the
codebase and several of its figures came from a single agent's query. **Ten of
its claims have now been corrected.** Treat its numbers as leads and re-derive
anything used as an acceptance criterion — a check tuned to reproduce a wrong
figure passes review and fails in production.

| # | Spec claim | Actual | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Cash application missing | Exists and works — `receiptMatchService`, `customerPaymentAllocationService`. MCP cannot reach it | REPORTED |
| A2 | Payroll absent / "no payroll process" | Real PAYE/UIF/SDL/ETI engines; `payrollJournalPostingService` posts a guarded journal | REPORTED |
| A3 | `settle_by_contra` needs building | WRAP — `bank_account_id` is a plain FK to `gl_accounts` with no subtype check; only the *labelling* is missing | FIXING (W1) |
| A4 | `list_unapplied_receipts` "exists as a UI report" | Does not exist. No occurrence of "unapplied" in the codebase | FIXING (W1) |
| A5 | 55 prior periods open | **56** on Brightsphere; 20 on Velocity | REPORTED |
| A6 | Every 2027 period closed | **Brightsphere only.** Velocity's 2027 is fully open — the two companies need opposite corrections | REPORTED |
| A7 | Nothing ever reconciled, both companies | True of those two; false system-wide — 2 reconciliations exist elsewhere | REPORTED |
| A8 | GL bank overstated R5.87m | Does not reproduce. R2,439,742.35 (VF) + R6,501,755.10 (BS) = R8.94m | UNVERIFIED — sign convention being checked |
| A9 | Payroll GL "deactivated and empty" | Deactivated on **Brightsphere only**; Velocity's five are active. Both empty | REPORTED |
| A10 | Budgets are a wrap | `budgetService` has **never executed** — see C1 | FIXING (W6) |

## B. Defects found that the specification never mentions

These are the ones that matter most: nobody was looking for them.

| # | Finding | Amount | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Equity computed without retained-earnings-brought-forward** across nine endpoints; seven computed it inline, so fixing the shared function alone would have left seven silently wrong | **R28,356,760.75** on Velocity's balance sheet | FIXED (parallel session) |
| B2 | **`allocateTransaction` with `allocType='customer'`** posts DR Bank / CR AR and writes NO allocation rows and NO `amount_paid`. This does not explain the unapplied cash — it *produces* it, and every bulk run adds to it | R2.45m and growing | REPORTED — write path, out of scope |
| B3 | **No canonical AR/AP control account.** 13 accounts carry `subtype='receivable'`, one carries NULL. Sub-ledgers tie to control on **no** company | variances to **R41.6m** | **OPEN — needs Hein's decision** |
| B4 | **`gl_accounts.is_active` used as a filter inside balance queries** in ~10 places. It is a picker flag and says nothing about whether an account holds money | 4 accounts hold **R137,317.39** incl. R6,550 cash | REPORTED — parallel session sweeping |
| B5 | `casewareExportService` filtered `is_active = true` and dropped a dormant account, leaving the export out of balance by exactly that | R130,000 | FIXED (parallel session) |
| B6 | **A predicate in a `LEFT JOIN ... ON` clause restricts nothing.** `kpiChartsService` had `is_active AND subtype='bank'` in an ON clause; unmatched rows survived with NULL account columns and were summed. The cash trend chart included every transaction in the company | — | REPORTED |
| B7 | **A `COALESCE` at the query layer makes a validation layer above it unreachable.** `getFiscalYearStartMonth` could not refuse a NULL because the SQL had already substituted 3 | — | FIXED (parallel session) |
| B8 | **`emp201Service` swallows every error** in a `try/catch` returning a zero-filled result, so a broken query reads as **"no PAYE due"** — a silent failure on a statutory return | — | REPORTED — escalated |
| B9 | `emp201Service` status filter is `'calculated'`, matching **1 of 86** pay runs | — | FIXING (parallel session) |
| B10 | **Zero of 39,285 journal lines** carry a `project_id`, across all four live companies. `projects` has 0 rows | 100% of P&L untagged | FIXING (W6) — reported as completeness, not an empty list |
| B11 | **Paycard coverage hole in both directions.** 12 Velocity 1610xxx accounts carry GL balance with zero transactions; 1544xxx accounts carry transactions with no GL | ~R99k | FIXING (W3) |
| B12 | A **completed** bank reconciliation with a R0.00 difference and **no matched transactions** — a reconciliation that proves nothing but looks done | — | FIXING (W3) |
| B13 | `fiscal_periods.fiscal_year` is **calendar-based**: Feb 2026 is stored as 2026 but belongs to the March-2025 fiscal year | — | REPORTED |
| B14 | **Silent March fiscal-year default.** `financial_year_start || 3` in 5 ad-hoc sites plus the shared basis. A December-year-end tenant would get a year-end close a quarter out with nothing flagging it | — | FIXED in the shared basis; 5 sites REPORTED |
| B15 | **`budgetService` has never executed.** INSERTs into 12 columns that do not exist, omits 2 NOT NULL columns, `ON CONFLICT` has no matching constraint. Write path and read path disagree about the schema | 0 rows in prod | FIXING (W6) |
| B16 | Brightsphere carries **R7,500 accumulated depreciation against R0 of asset cost** — negative net book value on the face of the balance sheet. Register and GL disagree in both directions | R7,500 | FIXING (W6) |
| B17 | Velocity has **no account coded 5200 or 1110**; salaries sit on Sage-imported `49784360` / `49784353`, so payroll posting cannot resolve its accounts | — | REPORTED |
| B18 | `users.id` is `character varying(255)`, not `uuid`. A uuid-typed FK or `::UUID` cast against it fails at apply time | — | REPORTED — CI guard exists |
| B19 | **Cash has two legitimate and disagreeing senses** — the GL ledger sense and the bank-statement-feed sense. `cash-movement` reads the feed, `reports-bank-transactions` reads the GL | — | FIXING (W3) — registering BOTH, gap is `bank_statement_coverage`'s output |

## C. Open — nobody owns these

**C1. Which account is *the* AR control account, and the AP one?**
There is no canonical answer in the schema, the sub-ledgers tie on no company,
and two reasonable queries give two different answers. `ar.control.v1` and
`ap.control.v1` are deliberately left unowned in
`src/lib/mcp/contracts/figures.ts` — registering an owner would encode an
arbitrary choice as truth and destroy the only thing that can detect the break.

Recommendation: `reconcile_subledger` reports **per control account** rather than
picking one, and `chart_of_accounts_health` flags that thirteen exist. The tools
then expose the ambiguity instead of resolving it silently. Deciding which
account *should* be canonical is a business call about the chart of accounts.

**Owner: Hein.**

## D. Deliberately not fixed

Recorded so that "we knew and chose not to" is distinguishable from "we missed
it". Each is correct to leave.

- **Every data correction on the Velocity and Brightsphere books.** Out of scope
  by decision; happens after the endpoints exist.
- **B2 `allocateTransaction`.** Write path. Fixing it stops the bucket filling;
  it does not empty it, and it is not this programme's scope.
- **The 5 ad-hoc fiscal-year derivations.** Two are payroll and two are AFS;
  converging them now would collide across workstreams. Registered in the figure
  registry's `contested` field so a sixth is not written.
- **No backfill of `actor_type`.** A derived value can be corrected when the
  derivation proves wrong; a backfilled one can never afterwards be told from a
  recorded one, which is the property that makes an audit trail worth having.
- **The payroll GL accounts on Brightsphere.** Activating an account is a
  production data change. `post_payroll_journal` refusing and naming the codes
  IS the correct output.
